# RogueGlyph
A simple Roguelike written in Glyph. Currently in works.  

## Usage
The arrow keys allow you to move around the Pointwise display window. I've included a template to generate your own characters called *pixel.pw*. I envision someone running this and having it procedurally generating levels in an unused layer.
